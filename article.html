  <h3>Take a look at how Melbourne has changed over the past decade, thanks to all this really interesting data</h3>

<div class="article">
  <p>Melbourne CBD streetscape is constantly changing and as one shop shuts and another opens, a tale of the city's past and future unfolds.</p>
  <p>Think of the video rental outlet replaced by a supermarket as more people choose to live in the CBD than ever before.</p>
  <p>This EzyMart convenience store was once a Pie Face outlet, and before that it was a discount camera store.</p>

  <p>Lord Mayor Robert Doyle said Melbourne was a pretty cool place.</p>
